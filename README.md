# TaskManager

## Description
TaskManager is a console-based C++ application designed for managing tasks.
The application allows users to create, view, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed through a simple console interface.
This project was created as a portfolio application to demonstrate practical C++ skills, including file handling, program structure, and basic CRUD logic.

## Features
- Create new task
- View existing tasks
- Edit tasks
- Delete tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Console-based menu navigation
## Editable task fields
- Title
- Description
- Date

## Data Storage
All tasks are stored in local text files.
This ensures data persistence between program runs and demonstrates basic file-based storage implementation.

## Technologies
- C++
- STL (string, vector)
- File I/O (fstream)
- Console application (Windows)

## Build and Run

- Build using g++
`g++ -std=c++23 \*.cpp -o TaskManager`
- Run
`TaskManager`

## Project Goals
- Practice modern C++
- Work with file input/output
- Implement CRUD operations
- Build a portfolio project for Junior / Trainee C++ positions

## Possible Improvements
- Task priorities
- Sorting and filtering
- Improved file format (IDs, timestamps)
- Refactoring to separate logic and storage
- Unit tests
